Motivations behind changing career:

My life, like most, has taken some trajectory changes - I started out highly interested in computers, software etc. I went to school for it at Rochester Institute of Technology for a year. A lot of it I loved, but one major point that dismayed me was a summer internship in a windowless lab. I burned out. I craved to be around people and outside. I took the opportunity to help my father open an inn in the Adirondacks. I got to work with people all day long while also building the website and implementing better SaaS products to upgrade the Inn's systems. After a couple of years I looked at my next path of development. I took a part time job at REI with the intention of going back to school however, REI offered me a full time job that led into a Sales Management position in Burlington, VT. The time came after 2 years of management experience, post pandemic lockdown, to take the steps towards my education. I was introduced to Turing through my good friend Sam who said he was seeing a lot of the grads getting jobs in the industry. Turing has a strong message that I agree with, we get people industry ready and we want to make the field more equal. The stars aligned and the pieces fit -- Turing is my next step.
