Favorite vacation:

- Ski touring in Garabaldi National Park, British Columbia.

  My significant other and I took a trip out to British Columbia in February 2019 and embarked on a few night ski touring trip through the mountains of Garabaldi Nation Park. The trip consisted of remote mountain scapes, fresh snow, warm sleeping bags, dinners with strangers and beers in a remote warming lodge with new acquantances. We unfortunately had to turn back before completing the entire 50 mile traverse because the glacier conditions were not safe -- it didn't stop the trek from being a highlight.
